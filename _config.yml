intro: |
  I am an engineer with 4 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked on the Development, but have worked across a broad range of technologies there on: Python, Django, Shell Scripting and most recently ML. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery and most recently to React. <br/><br/>
  I enjoy building interesting products, with a good Product Management focus and a good emphasis on good engineering principles and clean code (having worked across differing languages on the PVM, I recognise that good code is contextual).<br/><br/>
